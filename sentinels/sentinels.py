# Design and implementation decisions:
#
# The first implementations created a dedicated class for each instance.
# However, once it was decided to use Sentinel for type signatures, there
# was no longer a need for a dedicated class for each sentinel value on order
# to enable strict type signatures.  Since class objects consume a relatively
# large amount of memory, the implementation was changed to avoid this.
#
# With this change, the mechanism used for unpickling/copying objects needed
# to be changed too, since we could no longer count on each dedicated class
# simply returning its singleton instance as before.  __reduce__ can return
# a string, upon which an attribute with that name is looked up in the module
# and returned.  However, that would have meant that pickling/copying support
# would depend on the "name" argument being exactly the name of the variable
# used in the module, and simply wouldn't work for sentinels created in
# functions/methods.  Instead, a registry for sentinels was added, where all
# sentinel objects are stored keyed by their name + module name.  This is used
# to look up existing sentinels both during normal object creation and during
# copying/unpickling.
